while excutng the Resume_Rank_Groq.ipynb in kaggle notebook
encountered key error
below is the code snippet from rank_candidtes function from notebook

 scores.append({
            "Name": resume["Name"],
            "Skill Score": skill_score,
            "Experience Score": experience_score,
            "Education Score": education_score,
            "Keyword Match Score": keyword_match_score,
            "Total Score": total_score
        })

from above snippet the error occured becuase of this line
<<<<<<<<<<<" "Name": resume["Name"],">>>>>>>
this line gave the error because of the input dctionrty file which 
we parsed using groq llm 
  "Contact Information": {
    "Name": "Steve Sun",
    "Email": "stevesun1245@gmail.com",
    "Phone Number": "(123)456789",
    "Website/Portfolio/LinkedIn": "linkedin.com/in/stevesun",
    "Github Profile": null

above the part of the dict() file input which is he source of the key error
as our code line <<<<<<<<<<<" "Name": resume["Name"],">>>>>>>
only append list of string but our grog input is dictionary so
we need to modify the this line to also append or extrct the name from the dict() as well
modified code line:
<<<<<<<<"Name": resume.get("Name") or resume["Contact Information"]["Name"]>>>>>>>>
thi will solve the error..
